### License
If you want to use the code in your app, hire me instead. If you want to watch and learn, feel free to do it. And please, at least change variable names if you decide to steal it. Because if I somehow find out that you're selling my work or using it in your application without my explicit permission, I will find you and you will fucking pay for that, capisci? This is basically an equivalent of CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, but you can use this if you get my explicit permission to do so.
